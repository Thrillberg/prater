# Prater

## What the hell is Prater?

Prater is a chat web application (well in the near future) build using Elixir and Phoenix framework.

I'm building the application in order to learn Phoenix and describe the process of learning/building that app on my [blog](http://whatdidilearn.info/tags#Phoenix). 

Building the application like that allows me to cover a wide range of topics.

The implementation may miss some points, can have no tests and unfinished features. But that is mostly because those topics are waiting their time to be described in the blog.

Let's see how far it would lead me in my learning journey.

## How to try it out

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
